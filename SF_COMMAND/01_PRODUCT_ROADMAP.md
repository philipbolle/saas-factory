# SaaS Factory - Product Roadmap (v2.7)

### CAMPAIGN 1: The Flagship Product (STATUS: ACTIVE)
**Objective:** To build a single, enterprise-grade SaaS product that will serve as the validation engine for all future systems. The "SaaS Factory" will be forged from the successful patterns and components of this flagship application.

**Key Missions (Mandated Operations):**

* **Phase 1: Foundational Readiness & Architecture**
    * [X] **Mission FP-00: Foundational Readiness:** Pass all items in the Pre-Mission Readiness Protocol (Stop/Go Checklist) as defined in the Grand Unified Doctrine.
    * [X] **Mission FP-01 (AI-Led):** Implement the core backend abstraction layer based on Operator-provided specifications.
    * [X] **Mission FP-02 (AI-Led):** Establish the initial, secure CI/CD pipeline and testing framework based on Operator-provided specifications.
* **Phase 2: AI-Assisted Development & Internal Validation**
    * [ ] **Mission FP-03:** Develop AI Competency Benchmarks within the context of the flagship product's codebase.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-04.5 (Upgraded): The Simulation Gauntlet:** The AI must build and run an automated test harness that proves the architecture's resilience against catastrophic failure scenarios. The system must pass all simulations to be considered viable.
        * **DB Outage Simulation:** System aborts gracefully and recovers without data corruption when the database connection is severed during a live transaction.
        * **Cost Explosion Simulation:** System automatically halts jobs and alerts the Operator when a simulated runaway process exceeds predefined daily cost caps.
        * **API Key Abuse Simulation:** System correctly rate-limits, alerts, and provides a mechanism to revoke a key under a simulated high-frequency attack.
        * **Backup & Restore Simulation:** System demonstrates a successful restoration of a deleted tenant from a backup within a documented Service Level Agreement (SLA).
        * **Adversarial Security Simulation:** System successfully resists a battery of automated SQL injection and XSS attacks from a secondary AI agent.
    * [X] **Mission FP-04:** Build the core application features (auth, database, UI shell) using the VLM 2.1 protocols.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-04.7 (NEW): Minimum Viable Feedback:** Implement a basic, frictionless in-app feedback mechanism to establish an early customer feedback loop, in line with the MVE doctrine.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-05:** Achieve a production-ready MVE of the flagship product.

### CAMPAIGN 2: The SaaS Factory Core (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To extract, generalize, and automate the battle-tested patterns from the Flagship Product to create the foundational SaaS development system.
**Key Missions (Mandated Operations):**
* [ ] **Mission SF-01:** Refactor the flagship's core modules into a universal scaffolding tool.
* [ ] **Mission SF-02:** Evolve the AI framework to autonomously handle VLM-1 and VLM-2 tasks within the new factory context.
* [ ] **Mission SF-03:** Implement a fully automated, end-to-end CI/CD pipeline with VLM-3 hard halts.

**(Note: Campaigns 3, 4, and 5 - formerly Autonomous Operations, Strategic Evolution, etc. - are now designated as `ENTERPRISE PHASE II` and are PENDING the successful completion of Campaigns 1 and 2.)**

### CAMPAIGN 3: The Command Console V2 (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To refactor the authenticated user dashboard into a professional-grade, data-dense analysis tool that provides real-time, actionable intelligence.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission CC-01:** Integrate a sortable, searchable data table.
* [ ] **Mission CC-02:** Add historical data charting and visualization.
* [ ] **Mission CC-03:** Design and implement the full "Protocol Engine" UI.

### CAMPAIGN 4: The Autonomous Proving Grounds (Strategic Evolution Engine) (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To build and operate a perpetual evolution system that autonomously validates, tests, and optimizes SaaS products. This engine uses both internal simulations and live public micro-deployments to ensure every product remains at the pinnacle of its market.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission SEE-01:** Autonomous Validation & Optimization: Develop an AI agent that runs continuous A/B tests and deploys winning variants without manual intervention by using sandboxed, live user segments and single-feature public experiments.
* [ ] **Mission SEE-02:** Feature-Gated Deployment Pipeline: Create a system for rolling out new features to specific user segments to gather feedback and manage risk.
* [ ] **Mission SEE-03:** Market Analysis & Feature Generation: Build a system that continuously monitors market trends and competitor features to autonomously generate and prioritize new feature ideas.

### CAMPAIGN 5: Customer-Centric Evolution (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To build a robust system for collecting, analyzing, and integrating customer feedback into the product development lifecycle.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission CCE-01:** Implement a frictionless in-app feedback collection tool.
* [ ] **Mission CCE-02:** Develop an AI-powered sentiment analysis and feedback categorization system.
* [ ] **Mission CCE-03:** Create a transparent "customer council" portal to share feedback trends and upcoming features with early adopters.

### CAMPAIGN 6: Operator-Led Refinement (STATUS: RECURRING)
**Objective:** To prevent skill atrophy and ensure strategic alignment by mandating hands-on Operator intervention.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission OLR-01:** Conduct a quarterly manual code audit and refactoring session.
* [ ] **Mission OLR-02:** Perform an annual strategic review and amendment of the Grand Unified Doctrine.

---
## ENTERPRISE PHASE III: The Autonomous SaaS Ecosystem (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To expand the SaaS Factory's capabilities by building a suite of autonomous, interoperable SaaS products that manage the entire business lifecycle for both internal operations and end-users. Each new product will be forged and validated by the SaaS Factory itself.

### CAMPAIGN 7: The Marketing Engine (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To build "SaaS Marketer," an autonomous marketing and lead generation platform.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission SME-01:** Develop an AI agent for autonomous content creation and distribution.
* [ ] **Mission SME-02:** Implement an automated ad campaign management and optimization system.
* [ ] **Mission SME-03:** Integrate a full-funnel analytics and lead nurturing engine.

### CAMPAIGN 8: The Sales Engine (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To build "SaaS Seller," an automated sales and CRM platform.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission SSE-01:** Implement an AI-powered lead scoring and qualification system.
* [ ] **Mission SSE-02:** Create a fully automated user onboarding and conversion pipeline.
* [ ] **Mission SSE-03:** Integrate with the Billing Path for seamless subscription management.

### CAMPAIGN 9: The Support Engine (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To build "SaaS Support," an autonomous customer support and success platform.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission SSU-01:** Develop an AI-powered support agent for instant query resolution.
* [ ] **Mission SSU-02:** Implement a proactive customer success and churn-prevention system.
* [ ] **Mission SSU-03:** Integrate with the "Customer Council" portal from Campaign 5.
