# SaaS Factory - Product Roadmap (v2.5)

### CAMPAIGN 1: The Flagship Product (STATUS: ACTIVE)
**Objective:** To build a single, enterprise-grade SaaS product that will serve as the validation engine for all future systems. The "SaaS Factory" will be forged from the successful patterns and components of this flagship application.

**Key Missions (Mandated Operations):**

* **Phase 1: Foundational Readiness & Architecture**
    * [ ] **Mission FP-00: Foundational Readiness:** Pass all items in the Pre-Mission Readiness Protocol (Stop/Go Checklist) as defined in the Grand Unified Doctrine.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-01:** Operator to design and implement the core backend abstraction layer.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-02:** Operator to establish the initial, secure CI/CD pipeline and testing framework.
* **Phase 2: AI-Assisted Development & Internal Validation**
    * [ ] **Mission FP-03:** Develop AI Competency Benchmarks within the context of the flagship product's codebase.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-04:** Build the core application features (auth, database, UI shell) using the VLM 2.1 protocols.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-04.5 (Upgraded): The Simulation Gauntlet:** The AI must build and run an automated test harness that proves the architecture's resilience against catastrophic failure scenarios. The system must pass all simulations to be considered viable. The gauntlet must include, at a minimum:
        * **DB Outage Simulation:** System aborts gracefully and recovers without data corruption when the database connection is severed during a live transaction.
        * **Cost Explosion Simulation:** System automatically halts jobs and alerts the Operator when a simulated runaway process exceeds predefined daily cost caps.
        * **API Key Abuse Simulation:** System correctly rate-limits, alerts, and provides a mechanism to revoke a key under a simulated high-frequency attack.
        * **Backup & Restore Simulation:** System demonstrates a successful restoration of a deleted tenant from a backup within a documented Service Level Agreement (SLA).
        * **Adversarial Security Simulation:** System successfully resists a battery of automated SQL injection and XSS attacks from a secondary AI agent.
    * [ ] **Mission FP-05:** Achieve a production-ready MVP of the flagship product.

### CAMPAIGN 2: The SaaS Factory Core (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To extract, generalize, and automate the battle-tested patterns from the Flagship Product to create the foundational SaaS development system.
**Key Missions (Mandated Operations):**
* [ ] **Mission SF-01:** Refactor the flagship's core modules into a universal scaffolding tool.
* [ ] **Mission SF-02:** Evolve the AI framework to autonomously handle VLM-1 and VLM-2 tasks within the new factory context.
* [ ] **Mission SF-03:** Implement a fully automated, end-to-end CI/CD pipeline with VLM-3 hard halts.

**(Note: Campaigns 3, 4, and 5 - formerly Autonomous Operations, Strategic Evolution, etc. - are now designated as `ENTERPRISE PHASE II` and are PENDING the successful completion of Campaigns 1 and 2.)**

### CAMPAIGN 3: The Command Console V2 (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To refactor the authenticated user dashboard into a professional-grade, data-dense analysis tool that provides real-time, actionable intelligence.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission CC-01:** Integrate a sortable, searchable data table.
* [ ] **Mission CC-02:** Add historical data charting and visualization.
* [ ] **Mission CC-03:** Design and implement the full "Protocol Engine" UI.

### CAMPAIGN 4: The Autonomous Proving Grounds (Strategic Evolution Engine) (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To build and operate a perpetual evolution system that autonomously validates, tests, and optimizes SaaS products. This engine uses both internal simulations and live public micro-deployments to ensure every product remains at the pinnacle of its market.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission SEE-01:** Autonomous Validation & Optimization: Develop an AI agent that runs continuous A/B tests and deploys winning variants without manual intervention by using sandboxed, live user segments and single-feature public experiments.
* [ ] **Mission SEE-02:** Feature-Gated Deployment Pipeline: Create a system for rolling out new features to specific user segments to gather feedback and manage risk.
* [ ] **Mission SEE-03:** Market Analysis & Feature Generation: Build a system that continuously monitors market trends and competitor features to autonomously generate and prioritize new feature ideas.

### CAMPAIGN 5: Customer-Centric Evolution (STATUS: PENDING)
**Objective:** To build a robust system for collecting, analyzing, and integrating customer feedback into the product development lifecycle.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission CCE-01:** Implement a frictionless in-app feedback collection tool.
* [ ] **Mission CCE-02:** Develop an AI-powered sentiment analysis and feedback categorization system.
* [ ] **Mission CCE-03:** Create a transparent "customer council" portal to share feedback trends and upcoming features with early adopters.

### CAMPAIGN 6: Operator-Led Refinement (STATUS: RECURRING)
**Objective:** To prevent skill atrophy and ensure strategic alignment by mandating hands-on Operator intervention.
**Key Missions:**
* [ ] **Mission OLR-01:** Conduct a quarterly manual code audit and refactoring session.
* [ ] **Mission OLR-02:** Perform an annual strategic review and amendment of the Grand Unified Doctrine.
