# The Grand Unified Doctrine (v2.2)

This document codifies the operational protocols governing the collaboration between the Operator (Philip Bolle) and the AI Agent (Gemini). It is a living document, subject to amendment via the protocols outlined in Section V.

## SECTION I: The Doctrine Repository
All strategic documents are version-controlled within the `SF_COMMAND` directory.

- **`00_GRAND_UNIFIED_DOCTRINE.md`**: (This file) Our constitution and Standard Operating Procedure.
- **`00_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`**: The AI's long-term memory. The foundational principles of the brand, product, and technology.
- **`01_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`**: The strategic, multi-campaign product vision.
- **`02_MISSION_LOG.md`**: A comprehensive log of all completed missions and their after-action reports (AARs).
- **`blueprint.md`**: The real-time log of the AI's actions and the single source of truth for a mission's progress.

## SECTION II: The Agentic Workflow

1.  **Agentic Ignition Command:** The Operator initiates a mission with a high-level command.
    > `Commander, reporting for duty. The primary source of truth is located at [Repo Link]. The next mission is... [Mission Objective].`
2.  **AI Execution & Verification:** The AI will interpret the command and execute using the **Plan, Type, Test Protocol** according to the Verification Level Matrix (VLM) defined below.
    * **Phase A (Plan):** Create a detailed, step-by-step execution plan in `blueprint.md`, outlining the required architecture, file structure, and components.
    * **Phase B (Type):** Define all necessary data structures, types, and interfaces before implementation. This provides a clear contract for the code to follow.
    * **Phase C (Test):** Generate unit and integration tests based on the plan and types. The implementation must satisfy these tests.
3.  **Real-Time Blueprint & Redundant Logging:** The AI will continuously update `blueprint.md`. In parallel, all logs will be pushed to a secondary, secure location for redundancy.
4.  **Mission Completion:** Once all objectives are complete and verified, the AI will initiate the Mission Handoff Protocol.

## SECTION III: Verification Level Matrix (VLM)

All AI actions are classified into one of four levels. This matrix is governed by the **Cumulative Risk Protocol**, which automatically elevates an action's VLM level if a series of related tasks exceeds a predefined complexity or volume threshold within a single operational window.

* **VLM-0 (Autonomous Notification):** For non-intrusive, read-only tasks (e.g., fetching dependencies, running `git status`).
    * **Protocol:** The AI will execute the task and log the action in `blueprint.md`. No notification is required.

* **VLM-1 (Autonomous Action):** For routine, low-risk, and easily reversible tasks (e.g., installing dependencies, running linters, generating boilerplate).
    * **Protocol:** The AI will execute the task without a halt. The action and its outcome will be logged in `blueprint.md`. Actions are monitored by the Cumulative Risk Protocol.

* **VLM-2 (Peer Review & Proceed):** For medium-risk tasks that have operational significance but are not irreversible (e.g., creating new components, non-destructive schema changes, generating new tests).
    * **Protocol:** Before execution, the proposed code or action will be submitted to a secondary, sandboxed AI agent for an automated peer review. This review checks for logical flaws, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to doctrine. Upon successful peer review, the AI will issue a notification: `VLM-2 Notification: [Summary of action]. Peer review passed. Proceeding in [T-minus time]. Operator intervention will halt.`

* **VLM-3 (Hard Halt & Verify):** For high-risk, irreversible, or mission-critical actions (e.g., production deployment, database migration, credential management, core architectural changes).
    * **Protocol:** The AI will halt all execution and issue a verification request: `VLM-3 Verification Required: [Detailed summary of action and rationale, including peer review report]. Awaiting Operator confirmation.` Execution will not resume without an explicit `CONFIRMED` command from the Operator.

## SECTION IV: Operator Engagement & Handoff Protocols

### Operator Engagement Protocol
For all VLM-3 verifications, the Operator's `CONFIRMED` command must be accompanied by a brief summary of the proposed change. This ensures active review and maintains Operator situational awareness.
> `CONFIRMED. [Operator's one-sentence summary of the change].`

### Mission Handoff Protocol
1.  Upon mission completion, the AI will issue the following message:
    > `Mission complete. All systems are green. The mission log and blueprint have been updated. Awaiting Operator review and final deployment confirmation.`
2.  The Operator will conduct a final review and acceptance testing.

### Rollback Protocol
In the event of a critical failure post-deployment, a rollback to the previous stable version will be initiated. The AI will be responsible for executing the rollback and providing a post-mortem analysis within one operational window.

## SECTION V: Doctrine Amendment Protocol

This doctrine is a living document. Amendments can be proposed under the following conditions:
1.  An After-Action Report (AAR) for any mission concludes with a formal recommendation for a doctrinal change.
2.  The Operator initiates a strategic review.
All changes must be committed to the SSoT with an updated version number.
