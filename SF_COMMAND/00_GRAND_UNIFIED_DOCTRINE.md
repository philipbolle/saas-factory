# The Grand Unified Doctrine (v2.6)

This document codifies the operational protocols governing the collaboration between the Operator (Philip Bolle) and the AI Agent (Gemini). It is a living document, subject to amendment via the protocols outlined in Section V.

## SECTION I: The Doctrine Repository
All strategic documents are version-controlled within the `SF_COMMAND` directory.

- **`00_GRAND_UNIFIED_DOCTRINE.md`**: (This file) Our constitution and Standard Operating Procedure.
- **`00_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`**: The AI's long-term memory. The foundational principles of the brand, product, and technology.
- **`01_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`**: The strategic, multi-campaign product vision.
- **`02_MISSION_LOG.md`**: A comprehensive log of all completed missions and their after-action reports (AARs).
- **`blueprint.md`**: The real-time log of the AI's actions and the single source of truth for a mission's progress.

## SECTION II: The Agentic Workflow

1.  **Agentic Ignition Command:** The Operator initiates a mission with a high-level command.
2.  **AI Execution & Verification (Generate, then Verify Protocol):** The AI will interpret the command and execute using the **Plan, Type, Test Protocol**. All AI-generated outputs for significant tasks must be **testable artifacts** (e.g., code, scripts, configuration files), not high-level prose. These artifacts must then be subjected to a **verification step** (e.g., a red-team analysis by a secondary AI, passing a test harness) before being integrated.
3.  **Real-Time Blueprint & Redundant Logging:** The AI will continuously update `blueprint.md`. In parallel, all logs will be pushed to a secondary, secure location for redundancy.
4.  **Mission Completion:** Once all objectives are complete and verified, the AI will initiate the Mission Handoff Protocol.

### SECTION II.A: Pre-Mission Readiness Protocol (The Stop/Go Checklist)
No mission within any campaign may be initiated until the system passes the following automated checks. A failure on any item constitutes a "FAIL" state, and no further action may be taken on the mission until the failure is rectified.

* **Repo Reality Check:** The repository must contain a `src` directory, package manifests (`package.json` or `pyproject.toml`), and a build script. **PASS/FAIL**
* **Automated Build:** The command `npm ci && npm run build` (or Python equivalent) must complete without errors. **PASS/FAIL**
* **Billing Path Integrity:** A test harness must successfully simulate a Stripe checkout, create a new tenant, and validate the new tenant's API key. **PASS/FAIL**
* **Security Scan:** An automated scan (`npm audit` or `snyk test`) must report zero critical vulnerabilities or committed secrets. **PASS/FAIL**
* **Budget Safety Net:** Cloud cost alerts and API usage quotas must be confirmed as active and enforced. **PASS/FAIL**
* **VLM-3 Policy:** The VLM-3 Hard Halt policy must be documented and enforceable. **PASS/FAIL**

## SECTION III: Verification Level Matrix (VLM)

All AI actions are classified into one of four levels. This matrix is governed by the **Cumulative Risk Protocol**, which automatically elevates an action's VLM level if a series of related tasks exceeds a predefined complexity or volume threshold within a single operational window.

* **VLM-0 (Autonomous Notification):** For non-intrusive, read-only tasks (e.g., fetching dependencies, running `git status`).
    * **Protocol:** The AI will execute the task and log the action in `blueprint.md`. No notification is required.

* **VLM-1 (Autonomous Action):** For routine, low-risk, and easily reversible tasks (e.g., installing dependencies, running linters, generating boilerplate).
    * **Protocol:** The AI will execute the task without a halt. The action and its outcome will be logged in `blueprint.md`. Actions are monitored by the Cumulative Risk Protocol.

* **VLM-2 (Peer Review & Proceed):** For medium-risk tasks that have operational significance but are not irreversible (e.g., creating new components, non-destructive schema changes, generating new tests).
    * **Protocol:** Before execution, the proposed code or action will be submitted to a secondary, sandboxed AI agent for an automated peer review. This review checks for logical flaws, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to doctrine. Upon successful peer review, the AI will issue a notification: `VLM-2 Notification: [Summary of action]. Peer review passed. Proceeding in [T-minus time]. Operator intervention will halt.`

* **VLM-3 (Hard Halt & Verify):** For high-risk, irreversible, or mission-critical actions (e.g., production deployment, database migration, credential management, core architectural changes).
    * **Protocol:** The AI will halt all execution and issue a verification request: `VLM-3 Verification Required: [Detailed summary of action and rationale, including peer review report]. Awaiting Operator confirmation.` Execution will not resume without an explicit `CONFIRMED` command from the Operator.
    * **Foundation Review Clause:** If the AI determines that a foundational element established by the Operator (e.g., an architectural pattern, a CI/CD configuration) is a significant blocker to mission success, it is authorized to issue a `VLM-3 Verification Request` to propose a necessary amendment. This ensures that Operator-forged components are subject to the same rigorous validation as AI-generated ones.

## SECTION IV: Operator Engagement & Handoff Protocols

### Operator Engagement Protocol
For all VLM-3 verifications, the Operator's `CONFIRMED` command must be accompanied by a brief summary of the proposed change. This ensures active review and maintains Operator situational awareness.
> `CONFIRMED. [Operator's one-sentence summary of the change].`

### Mission Handoff Protocol
1.  Upon mission completion, the AI will issue the following message:
    > `Mission complete. All systems are green. The mission log and blueprint have been updated. Awaiting Operator review and final deployment confirmation.`
2.  The Operator will conduct a final review and acceptance testing.

### Rollback Protocol
In the event of a critical failure post-deployment, a rollback to the previous stable version will be initiated. The AI will be responsible for executing the rollback and providing a post-mortem analysis within one operational window.

### Quarterly Red Team Simulation
On the first day of each quarter, the Operator will task an independent AI agent (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) with a "Doctrine Collapse Simulation." The goal is to identify single points of failure, strategic fragility, and doctrinal blind spots. The outcome of this simulation will be logged, and any critical findings must be addressed within that quarter's operational window.

## SECTION V: Doctrine Amendment Protocol

This doctrine is a living document. Amendments can be proposed under the following conditions:
1.  An After-Action Report (AAR) for any mission concludes with a formal recommendation for a doctrinal change.
2.  The Operator initiates a strategic review.
All changes must be committed to the SSoT with an updated version number.

### Section V.A: Doctrine Override Clause (The "Red Handle" Protocol)
In scenarios where adherence to existing doctrine presents a clear and immediate existential threat or a critical competitive disadvantage, the Operator may invoke the "Red Handle" Protocol.

1.  **Declaration:** The Operator must declare the override in `blueprint.md` with the prefix `RED HANDLE`.
2.  **Justification:** The declaration must be followed by a one-sentence justification explaining the exigent circumstance.
3.  **Post-Action Review:** Any action taken under this protocol must be reviewed in the next After-Action Report (AAR), with a formal proposal to amend the doctrine to account for the scenario.

*This protocol is a weapon of last resort, designed to ensure survival, not to bypass standard procedure for convenience.*
