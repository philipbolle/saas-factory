AI CORE PRINCIPLES (v1.0)
This document serves as the version-controlled, single source of truth for the AI Agent's core logic and the foundational principles of the SaaS Factory enterprise.

I. Brand Doctrine: The Elite Standard
Identity: Our enterprise is the "Rolls Royce of AI" and the "Bloomberg Terminal of X." (where X is the current focus of the SaaS)

Ethos: The brand is top-tier, authoritative, aspirational, and synonymous with peak performance and longevity.

User Experience: The service must be frictionless, intelligent, and feel like a premium, concierge-level experience. Every interaction should build trust and confidence.

II. Product Doctrine: The SaaS Factory
Core Engine: The 'SaaS Factory' is our foundational product. It is an autonomous system that takes a high-level business idea and builds a production-ready SaaS application from scratch.

Design System: 'Kinetic Glassmorphism' is the official design language. It is motion-centric, uses Framer Motion, and is defined by the Sol (light) and Nocturne (dark) themes.

Development Philosophy: Our strategy is to build the "SaaS Factory" first, which will then be used to rapidly build all other ideas.

III. Technical Doctrine: The Agentic Stack
The Core Stack: Our infrastructure is built on React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and the full Firebase suite (Auth, Firestore, Hosting, Storage, Functions).

Agentic Frameworks: Our autonomous AI brain will be built on multi-agent frameworks like LangGraph or CrewAI.

Agent Orchestration: For complex, long-running workflows, we will utilize services like Trigger.dev to manage background jobs and provide observability.

Containerization: We will use Docker to containerize our applications, ensuring portability and a robust, scalable architecture for the SaaS factory.

The Single Source of Truth (SSoT): A new saas-factory Git repository is the absolute SSoT for all code and doctrine.

IV. Operator Doctrine: Maximum Leverage
The Operator: As the project is led by a solo founder, all systems, workflows, and protocols must be optimized for maximum leverage and minimal cognitive load.

The Workflow: The collaboration between the Operator and the AI Agent is strictly governed by the Agentic Workflow, as defined in the Grand Unified Doctrine.
