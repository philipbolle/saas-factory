# SaaS Factory - Mission Log (v1.1)
This document is the official, version-controlled archive of all SaaS Factory campaigns and their outcomes.

## CAMPAIGN: Initial Systems Setup
**MISSION:** Operational Reset
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** A full operational reset has been executed to establish a new, clean foundation for the SaaS Factory. All legacy files have been removed. A new SF_COMMAND directory has been created to house the doctrine for the new SaaS Factory project. A new Agentic Workflow has been codified in the Grand Unified Doctrine, and a new project roadmap and mission log have been created. The system is now ready for the first mission of Campaign 1: building the Agentic Core.

## CAMPAIGN 1: The Flagship Product

**MISSION:** FP-00: Foundational Readiness
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** Initialized project structure, installed dependencies, resolved multiple configuration conflicts for the build and test runners, and eliminated all security vulnerabilities. The system successfully passed all checks in the `Pre-Mission Readiness Protocol` and is now doctrinally compliant and ready for Campaign 1.

**MISSION:** FP-01: Implement Core Backend Abstraction Layer
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** Successfully designed and implemented a modular backend abstraction layer for Firebase services (Authentication and Firestore), isolating application logic from direct SDK dependencies as per the 'Principle of Pragmatic Abstraction'. Addressed an Operator-identified strategic inconsistency by provisioning a new, dedicated Firebase project (`saas-factory`) to ensure a clean foundation, rectifying a potential violation of the "Operational Reset" intent. All necessary configuration keys have been integrated by the Operator. The system is ready for the next phase.

**MISSION:** FP-02: Establish the initial, secure CI/CD pipeline and testing framework.
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:**
A comprehensive testing foundation has been established in accordance with the Test-Informed Development (TID) doctrine.
- **Unit/Integration Testing:** Created test suites for core backend services (`authService`, `firestoreService`) using Jest, validating their functionality and error handling. Resolved TypeScript configuration warnings (`esModuleInterop`) to ensure a clean and stable test environment.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Implemented a foundational "smoke test" using Cypress to ensure the application's core rendering integrity.
- **CI Automation:** Deployed a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to fully automate the linting, testing (unit, integration, and E2E), and build processes. This workflow acts as a quality and security gate for all future code contributions, enforcing the "Elite Standard" doctrine.
The system is now capable of autonomously verifying code quality before integration.
