# SaaS Factory - Mission Log (v1.4)
This document is the official, version-controlled archive of all SaaS Factory campaigns and their outcomes.

## CAMPAIGN: Initial Systems Setup
**MISSION:** Operational Reset
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** A full operational reset has been executed to establish a new, clean foundation for the SaaS Factory. All legacy files have been removed. A new SF_COMMAND directory has been created to house the doctrine for the new SaaS Factory project. A new Agentic Workflow has been codified in the Grand Unified Doctrine, and a new project roadmap and mission log have been created. The system is now ready for the first mission of Campaign 1: building the Agentic Core.

## CAMPAIGN 1: The Flagship Product

**MISSION:** FP-00: Foundational Readiness
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** Initialized project structure, installed dependencies, resolved multiple configuration conflicts for the build and test runners, and eliminated all security vulnerabilities. The system successfully passed all checks in the `Pre-Mission Readiness Protocol` and is now doctrinally compliant and ready for Campaign 1.

**MISSION:** FP-01: Implement Core Backend Abstraction Layer
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** Successfully designed and implemented a modular backend abstraction layer for Firebase services (Authentication and Firestore), isolating application logic from direct SDK dependencies as per the 'Principle of Pragmatic Abstraction'. Addressed an Operator-identified strategic inconsistency by provisioning a new, dedicated Firebase project (`saas-factory`) to ensure a clean foundation, rectifying a potential violation of the "Operational Reset" intent. All necessary configuration keys have been integrated by the Operator. The system is ready for the next phase.

**MISSION:** FP-02: Establish the initial, secure CI/CD pipeline and testing framework.
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:**
A comprehensive testing foundation has been established in accordance with the Test-Informed Development (TID) doctrine.
- **Unit/Integration Testing:** Created test suites for core backend services (`authService`, `firestoreService`) using Jest, validating their functionality and error handling. Resolved TypeScript configuration warnings (`esModuleInterop`) to ensure a clean and stable test environment.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Implemented a foundational "smoke test" using Cypress to ensure the application's core rendering integrity.
- **CI Automation:** Deployed a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to fully automate the linting, testing (unit, integration, and E2E), and build processes. This workflow acts as a quality and security gate for all future code contributions, enforcing the "Elite Standard" doctrine.
The system is now capable of autonomously verifying code quality before integration.

**MISSION:** FP-04: Build Core Application Features (UI Shell & Auth)
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** Established the foundational frontend architecture.
- **UI Shell:** Implemented a basic layout (`Layout.tsx`), header (`Header.tsx`), and placeholder pages for key application sections.
- **Routing:** Integrated `react-router-dom` v6 to create a navigable single-page application structure, including protected routes for authenticated users.
- **Authentication Scaffolding:** Deployed a React Context-based authentication provider (`AuthContext.tsx`) that integrates with the `authService` backend abstraction. This provides a global state for user authentication, enabling sign-in, sign-out, and session persistence.
The system now has a functional, albeit minimal, user-facing interface with a complete authentication loop, setting the stage for feature development.

**MISSION:** FP-H1: Foundational Hardening & Verification
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:** Completed a comprehensive hardening protocol to achieve a fully green CI/CD pipeline.
- **Dependency Harmonization:** Upgraded ESLint dependencies to resolve critical version conflicts with TypeScript, eliminating all linting errors.
- **Configuration & Refactoring:** Corrected multiple configuration files (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `cypress.config.cjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`). Refactored the authentication context into a multi-file, single-responsibility structure to adhere to React best practices and resolve all `react-refresh` warnings.
- **E2E Workflow Hardening:** Integrated the `start-server-and-test` utility to create a robust, reliable, and self-contained end-to-end testing script, resolving all `ECONNREFUSED` errors.
The system is now fully compliant with the "Pre-Mission Readiness Protocol" and demonstrates a stable, professional-grade foundation.

**MISSION:** FP-04.5: The Simulation Gauntlet
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:**
- **Harness Construction:** Developed a suite of failure-simulation tests for critical backend services (`authService`, `firestoreService`) to act as a "gauntlet" for architectural resilience.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** The gauntlet immediately identified a critical vulnerability: the `firestoreService` lacked graceful error handling, which would have led to unhandled promise rejections and application instability under real-world failure conditions.
- **Architectural Hardening:** Refactored the `firestoreService` to include robust `try...catch` blocks, ensuring that backend failures are now handled gracefully without crashing the client application.
- **Verification:** The entire test suite, including the new failure simulations, now passes, providing doctrinal certainty that the system is resilient to these specific catastrophic failure scenarios. This mission has validated the core tenets of Test-Informed Development (TID).

**MISSION:** FP-04.7: Minimum Viable Feedback
**OUTCOME:** SUCCESS
**AAR:**
- **Feature Implementation:** Successfully implemented a frictionless, in-app feedback mechanism. A new `Feedback` page is now accessible from the main header, allowing both authenticated and unauthenticated users to submit feedback directly to a dedicated Firestore collection.
- **Doctrinal Compliance:** This feature directly addresses the "Minimum Viable Feedback" and "Pragmatic Validation" principles outlined in the Core Principles doctrine, establishing an early customer feedback loop critical for iterative development.
The system is now equipped to gather real-world user data, moving the project from internal simulation to external validation.
